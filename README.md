# Personal LeetCode repo

This reposity exists as a compilation of [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/hauntedcupoftea/) problems I have solved, as well as code for it. I'm thinking of how to best organise them, so for now I will divide it into languages used, and further into the problem number/name itself.

**ALL WORK IS MY OWN.**
