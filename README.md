# Personal Competitive Programming/DSA repo

This reposity exists as a compilation of onling DSA/Competitive Programming problems I have solved, as well as code for it. I'm thinking of how to best organise them, so for now I will divide it into the website itself, and then further into languages used, and further into the problem number/name itself.

## Account Information

- [My Leetcode Profile](https://leetcode.com/hauntedcupoftea/)
- [My CodeChef Profile (Work done before 2023 Not present in repo)](https://www.codechef.com/users/hauntedcupofte)

## Misc Information

This repo will be constantly changing and updating over time, but I hope I will by organised enough to keep this README up to date well. This is my effort to improve further on problem-solving skills, which may or may not related to AI but are always nice to have I suppose.
Work done before 2023 is absent from this repository. This is important to mention because I did do a full year of contests of CodeChef but cannot be bothered to post progress here. If I do anything new on it, it will be present here.
LeetCode progress is from scratch. Expect no more than 1-2 Discrepencies

## **ALL WORK IS MY OWN.**
